# Learning Philosophy

This course is built on several core principles:

1. **Motivation First, Skills Follow:** We believe that when you understand WHY visualization matters for business success, learning HOW becomes self-driven.

2. **Real Business Context:** Every example, dataset, and project comes from actual business scenarios to ensure immediate relevance.

3. **Progressive Complexity:** We start with simple, impactful visualizations and gradually introduce sophisticated techniques as your confidence grows.

4. **Learn by Doing:** Each lecture includes substantial hands-on practice because data visualization is a skill learned through creation, not observation.

5. **Business Communication:** Technical skills are necessary but insufficient - we emphasize translating data insights into business action.

## Course Success Strategies

**For Students:**
- Focus on the business question before choosing a visualization
- Experiment freely - data visualization is creative
- Seek feedback early and often
- Build a portfolio of your best visualizations
- Connect learnings to your career interests

**Expected Time Commitment:**
- Lectures: 3 hours/week
- Practice assignments: 3-4 hours/week
- Evaluation projects: 8-10 hours per module
- Total: ~8-10 hours per week
